## Project Description:
This assignment demonstrates version/ source control and shows my understanding of key concepts from the lesson.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control allows team members to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other.
2. A repository like Git gives every user a complete copy of repository data to store locally on a machine.
3. There is no point of failure in a GIT repository since users can't overwrite each other.
