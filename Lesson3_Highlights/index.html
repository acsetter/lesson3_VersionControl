            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a method that allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time without running into overwriting problems. A main repository is created for all of the project files. Team members review these files and make changes to them as necessary. After changes are made, they send them back to the repository via committing. This method solves the file sharing problem and members of a team can work remotely.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems keep track of the meta data of file changes. This means, it keeps track of who changed the files, when they changed them, the changes they made. When the user commits these changes, the changes that person made are merged with changes from other team members. Version Control systems, however, prevent files from being overwritten. A common repository holds all the latest files and allows you to revert back to an older version of the files/ project if needed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is simply a place where data is stored and managed. A repository allows members of a team record their change history a track previous changes and versions of a project. Two main types of repositories are local and remote. A local repository is one that is stored offline on a local machine. A remote repository is a centralized repository for team members to commit their changes to the files. An example of a remote repository is GIT. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a free and open source version control system for any sized project. It is fast, efficient, and the standard VCS for projects. GIT gives every user a complete copy of the repository data to store on their machine. This allows users to work offline and commit changes later. Like any VCS their is no point of failure with GIT and does not allow overwrites of data. You can program a machine or IDE to SSH files directly to a GIT repository via committing. This allows you to simply upload files via a few simple commands.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Working on an open source project with a team has a process to it. In layman's terms, the process is Add, commit, push. How this works, is you download a project from the remote repository or create a project from scratch. Then, you ADD your revisions and changes to a project. After you're finished with your portion of the contribution to the overall project, you commit those changes by uploading the files to a remote repository like GIT. Your changes are later, PUSHED to the source as a new version.</p>
